CHORD can distinguish BRCA1 and BRCA2 type in HRD group.

The likelihood ratio test was performed to evaluate how strong if having
a germline BRCA1/2mutation increases the likelihood of having somatic
HRD based on number of HRD samples in each germline group with VUS
BRCA1/2 group and P/LP or VUS in other genes excluded.

if we include HRD subtypes:

29 had been excluded due to carrying P/LP or suspicious VUS in
non-BRCA1/2 genes, out of these 29 individuals, 4 of them are HRD
(BRCA1), 4 are HRD (BRCA2) and 2 of them are HRD (Undetermined).
