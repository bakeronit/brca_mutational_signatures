Comparison of the HRD prediction from HRDetect and CHORD
================

Both HRDetect and CHORD had accurately predict HRD samples in the
Familial breast cancer cohort as Nones et al., 2019. For other cohorts,
there are five individuals been classified differently by two models.

| sample_id      |  HRDetect | CHORD | HRD-sum |
|:---------------|----------:|------:|--------:|
| MAGIC_2020_050 | 0.5993218 | 0.816 |      48 |
| MAGIC_2020_153 | 0.9089604 | 0.318 |      75 |
| GQ23P000003    | 0.8671400 | 0.300 |      58 |
| TCGA-A7-A13D   | 0.9111228 | 0.180 |      56 |
| TCGA-BH-A0B3   | 0.9441217 | 0.296 |      78 |

Notably, four out of these five samples were excluded by [germline
classification](xx), and `TCGA-A7-A13D` is classified as brca_negative
which is consistent with CHORD result.

For samples that are consistently predicted as HRD, CHORD further
classified them as BRCA1/2 type.
