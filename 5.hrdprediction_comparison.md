Comparison of the HRD prediction from HRDetect and CHORD
================

| sample_id      |  HRDetect | CHORD | HRD-sum |
|:---------------|----------:|------:|--------:|
| MAGIC_2020_050 | 0.5993218 | 0.816 |      48 |
| MAGIC_2020_153 | 0.9089604 | 0.318 |      75 |

There are five samples had inconsistent HR status perdition from two
methods.

Notably, four out of these five samples were excluded by germline
classification, and `TCGA-A7-A13D` is classified as brca_negative which
is consistent with CHORD result.

For samples that are consistently predicted as HRD, CHORD further
classified them as BRCA1/2 type.
