Since MAGIC cohort was composed of FFPE-derived samples, we did [FFPE
correction](FFPE_correction.md) to exam whether this affect our HRD
prediction.

Comparing the HRD prediction results before and after FFPE signature
correction, there is no impact to number of HRD samples except some
minor value changes.
