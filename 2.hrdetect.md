HRDetect HRD prediction
================

The HRDetect method uses the mutational signatures to predict BRCA1/2
deficiency as a surrogate for HR deficiency, including base substitution
signatures 3 and 8, indel patterns, SVs and the copy number-based score
HRD loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The `HRDetect_pipeline` function of
[signature.tools.lib](https://github.com/Nik-Zainal-Group/signature.tools.lib)
was used for the HRDetect implementation with 1000 bootstraps and
“Breast” specific signatures. A score of \>0.7 is considered to
represent deficiency.

Since MAGIC cohort was composed of FFPE-derived samples, we did [FFPE
correction](FFPE_correction.md) to exam whether this affect our HRD
prediction.

Comparing the HRD prediction results before and after FFPE signature
correction, there is no impact to number of HRD samples except some
minor value changes.
