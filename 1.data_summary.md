Data resources
================

In this analysis, we included whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of
pairs of primary tumour and normal blood (germline) samples from breast
cancer patients in four study cohorts. After filtering samples with low
quality and sequencing depth, we had 350 tumours from:

- familial breast cancer (N=77; Nones 2019)

- TCGA-BRCA (N=96; cite)

- MAGIC (N=136; De Silva et al. MJA 2023 ) -

- Q-IMPROvE (N=41; 10.5694/mja2.51900)

These datasets were used to call somatic variants from HRD prediction
and to call germline variants for germline BRCA1 and BRCA2
classification.

All samples were processed with a uniform pipeline and wWe applied the
dual calling pipeline for analysing WGS data of tumour samples with
matched germline samples to identify somatic SNV and indel changes.
Specifically, we aligned the short-read sequencing reads to the human
genome assembly (GRCh38) using BWA, and high confident somatic SNV were
identified as the intersect of post-filtered output of qSNP (cite) and
GATK HaplotypeCaller (cite). Short insertion and deletions (1-50bp) were
called with the GATK HaplotyperCaller. Mutations were annotated with
qannotate and SnpEff to identify somatic-specific mutations and filter
mutations located within 6 base pairs of a homopolymer region.

After removing samples with less then 20x depth in tumour sample, we
only keep the primary tumour from each patient.
