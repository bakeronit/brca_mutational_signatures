HRDsum scores
================

The HRDsum scores were calculated using the `scar_score()` function of
[modified scripts](scripts/hrdsum.R) based on scarHRD package.

There is no threshold for HRDsum score for distinguishing HRD samples
from non-HRD samples.

We did see higher HRDsum scores for HRD samples (CHORD) than non-HRD
samples, but there are many overlapping points especially other cohorts
than those Familial breast cancers.

Although there is no threshold for HRDsum scores. HRDsum with a cutoff
point of 42 is an FDA‐ and European Medicines Agency (EMA)‐approved
biomarker to select ovarian cancer patients for PARP inhibition.

Here we can see using a cut-off of 42 will predict a lot of non-HRD
(identified by CHORD) as HRD.
